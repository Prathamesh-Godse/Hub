> **It is next to impossible to implement all the ideas, and it is also pitiful if you can't make even one possible.**

We are in a state where more than 90% of startups fail within a year. To address this issue, a workshop was held at NITK, Surathkal. It involved a discussion on how a startup or an innovation culture should be, the problems faced by innovators, and interactions among various institutional delegates and innovators with the speakers on innovation parameters.

My expectations from the workshop were that I would get to learn a lot of stuff related to technology and innovation in the engineering sector. I also expected it to be interesting since I was given a chance to visit the campus and network with people.

The event took place on February 24, 2024, at NITK (National Institute of Technology, Karnataka). Well, everyone knows how reputed the institute is, and as the pride in the name suggests, even the hall was spacious enough to accommodate nearly 200 to 250 participants.

The speakers were Dr. Anamika Dey and Prof. Anil Gupta. First, Dr. Anamika Dey discussed HBNCRIIA (Honey Bee Network Creativity and Inclusive Innovation Awards India) and its operation, and also how many people benefited from it. Then, Prof. Anil Gupta explained various topics including "Upload to Download Ratio," how to find various open patents, and discussed people who were innovators.

After the workshop, my friends and I were allowed to explore the institution for a day. We went to the "Science and Technology Entrepreneurs' Park (NITK STEP)" where we talked to various innovators within the campus.

Then, we went to the Central Research Facility (CRF) where we were guided by the institution faculty who introduced us to various machineries. Machines used to detect elements in a sample, compounds in a sample, from detecting the surface of the material to radioactivity of the material.

After that, we visited the site where the radio communication project in its first working stage was situated, also called SEARCH. This SEARCH is meant to automate the surveillance system near the seashores.

Finally, after visiting all these, we went to the NITK beach and enjoyed the sunset.

At the end of the day, it was one of the great days of my life, seeing so many ambitious projects and such sophisticated machines. Additionally, listening to the professionals about their efforts in promoting innovation not only on the campus but also in the entire locality was truly inspiring.
