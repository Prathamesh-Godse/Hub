## Requirements 
1. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
3. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
4. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
5. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and login (if you already created one account) or register as new on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

## Create a folder in the system 
For ease of explanation we would say it as `EX-Portal`(the name of the folder we created). Enter into the folder and now copy the path of the folder `EX-Portal`. Let the path of the folder be `D:\EX-Portal`. Open Windows PowerShell and paste the below commands one by one.

Note : Replace the `D:\EX-Portal` with your file path/location.

```
cd D:\EX-Portal
```

```
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
```

```
cd quartz
```

```
npm i
```

```
npx quartz create
```
After Entering the above command you will see an option menu for creating and setting up quartz.
Where you have to select the 1<sup>st</sup> option for both the configurations.

Don't close the PowerShell, we'll gonna need it for further use.

## Some editing in the code

Go to Visual Studio Code and hit the search icon. Search for `Quartz 4.0`. You will see a file named `quartz.config.ts`. Open the file. In the 6<sup> th </sup> line of the code, where it says `pageTitle: "ðŸª´Quartz 4.0",`. Replace that with `pageTitle: "Anything that you want to be at the top of the site",`.
Save it.

## Content

Open Obsidian and then click on `Open folder as vault`. 

[Learn some basics on Obsidian from here](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax)

After getting some knowledge on how to use the Obsidian its time to create something for the website. Now get in to the folder named `content`. The path for the folder is `quartz\content`. Whatever you want to get displayed goes to the `content` folder. If you create a note outside the `content` it will not work at all.

## Build and Preview Site

Open the Windows PowerShell right where you left. Now to preview what you have built just paste the below command in PowerShell.

```
npx quartz build --serve
```
This will create a local web server for your website. Now copy the URL that the the above command outputs, which look like `http://localhost:8080/`. Then open a Web Browser of your own choice and then paste the URL and hit `Enter`.
You will see a preview of your website on the screen. If it worked, Congratulations ðŸŽŠ. You are good to proceed further.
The problem here is that the site is set locally and it cannot be seen anywhere else rather then on your Desktop. 

## Uploading to GitHub

Now open GitHub on your Favorite Browser and proceed to `create a Repository`. Name the Repository and set it as `public`(don't do anything apart from this). Hit `Enter` or `Create`.
Now after creating a Repository you will see a `https:` link in the top portion of the screen. Just copy that. 

Now in PowerShell paste the below commands one by one.

```
git remote -v
```

Replace the `REMOTE-URL` with the `https:` link copied earlier 
```
git remote set-url origin REMOTE-URL
```

The output of this is not an error:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
```

For initial push
```
npx quartz sync --no-pull
```

# Hosting

1. Open Cloudflare in your browser
2. Select `Workers and Pages`
3. Select `Create application`
4. Select `Pages`
5. Select `Connect to Git`
6. Select your GitHub Account and the Repository that you newly created(If your repository is not shown, configure repository access for theÂ [Cloudflare Pages](https://github.com/settings/installations/46922011)Â app on GitHub)
7. **Set up builds and deployments**Â section

|Configuration option|Value|
|---|---|
|Production branch|`v4`|
|Framework preset|`None`|
|Build command|`npx quartz build`|
|Build output directory|`public`|

8. Select `Save and Deploy`
9. Now in front of `Domains:` you see your website link

Now open Visual Studio Code and 
1. open **quartz** folder
2. open **.github** folder
3. open **workflows** folder
4. create a file named **deploy.yml**
5. Write the below code in the file
```
name: Deploy Quartz site to GitHub Pages
 
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - v4
 
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
 
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false
 
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for git info
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18.14
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build Quartz
        run: npx quartz build
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: public
 
  deploy:
    needs: build
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
```

6. Now go to **GitHub** 
7. Open the newly created Repository 
8. Select **Setting**
9. Select **Pages**
10. Under **Source** select **GitHub Actions**
11. Now go to Windows PowerShell and paste the below command
```
npx quartz sync
```

This deploys your site to `<github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>`. You can search this in your browser to get the site.

# Note

To preview site in local web server

```
npx quartz build --serve
```

To push and commit the changes to the website

```
npx quartz sync
```
